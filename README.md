# Google-Ad-Remover

DESCRIPTION

This is a chrome extension that is designed to work on Google searches. Its function is to eliminate the sections of the search results that display sponsored links to websites, effectively getting rid of the ads. The goal of this extension is to save time when you are searching for information and you want to access organic results.

An example of this would be if you want to find the best colleges in your state, you would bypass the links those colleges would pay to show up on your search and immediately find the links from blogs or other independent writers that compare/contrast various schools. The important thing is that this allows you to get directly to reviews instead of having to search the results page for the first organic listing.

I did leave the ad section that displays images, so that this extension can remain on and you can still find links to products in case you are actually searching for a specific product.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

1. click on the CODE button (green button) and select 'download zip'. Extract and save the file from github to your computer in a location where you can get to it for installation later, but it won't be in the way. I recommend saving it to your Documents folder. You should keep the folder on your computer, as the extension will not work if you delete the folder.

2. open chrome and navigate to the extension button and click the 'manage extensions' button on the bottom of the window.

3.This will open up the chrome://extensions window. Navigate to the upper right and click the toggle for Developer mode (should turn blue when clicked).

4. click 'Load unpacked' button on the new navbar that is at the top left, directly under the 'Extensions' word.

5. navigate to your saved folder on the desktop, and click 'select'.

6. make sure the extension shows up on the chrome://extensions page, and that it is turned on (should show a blue toggle on the bottom right of the extension window)

7. close the chrome browser, reopen it, then go to Google and try it out!
